# Hide Reply Buttons Implementation - Option A Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Option A**: Restored top-level reply button hiding under the existing `hide_reply_buttons_for_non_owners` setting.

The feature now provides comprehensive reply button hiding in two ways:
1. **Post-level**: Hides reply buttons on posts authored by non-owners
2. **Top-level**: Hides topic-level reply buttons (timeline footer, topic footer) when viewer is not the topic owner

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript - `javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/hide-reply-buttons.gjs`

**Added**:
- Viewer vs owner comparison logic
- Body class toggling based on viewer identity
- Enhanced logging for top-level button decisions
- Proper cleanup of body class on all exit paths

**Key Code**:
```javascript
// Determine if top-level reply buttons should be hidden
const currentUser = api.getCurrentUser();
const shouldHideTopLevel = !currentUser || currentUser.id !== topicOwnerId;

// Toggle body class for top-level button hiding
document.body.classList.toggle("hide-reply-buttons-non-owners", shouldHideTopLevel);
```

**Guard Conditions**:
- Setting disabled → Remove body class
- No topic → Remove body class
- Category not configured → Remove body class
- No topic owner data → Remove body class
- Viewer is owner → Remove body class
- Viewer is not owner → Add body class

### 2. CSS - `common/common.scss`

**Added**:
```scss
/* Hide top-level reply buttons when viewer is not the topic owner */
body.hide-reply-buttons-non-owners {
  /* Timeline footer controls (desktop) */
  .timeline-footer-controls .create,
  .timeline-footer-controls .reply-to-post,
  
  /* Topic footer main buttons */
  .topic-footer-main-buttons .create,
  .topic-footer-main-buttons .reply-to-post,
  
  /* Legacy topic footer buttons outlet */
  .topic-footer-buttons .create,
  .topic-footer-buttons .reply-to-post {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Updated**:
- Enhanced comments to explain both post-level and top-level hiding
- Clarified the two-part nature of the feature

### 3. Settings - `settings.yml`

**Updated description**:
```yaml
hide_reply_buttons_for_non_owners:
  type: bool
  default: false
  description: "Hide reply buttons in configured Owner comment categories: (1) post-level buttons on posts authored by non-owners, and (2) topic-level buttons (timeline footer, topic footer) when the viewer is not the topic owner. Applies in both filtered and regular topic views. Does not check Allowed groups. This is a UI-only restriction and does not prevent replies via keyboard shortcuts or API calls."
```

### 4. Tests - `test/acceptance/hide-reply-buttons-non-owners-test.js`

**Added**:
- New test: "hides top-level reply buttons when viewer is not owner"
- Body class assertions in existing tests
- Verification that body class is removed in unconfigured categories
- Verification that body class is removed when setting is disabled

## How It Works

### Post-Level Hiding (Unchanged)

1. JavaScript classifies each post as `owner-post` or `non-owner-post`
2. Classification based on: `post.user_id === topic.details.created_by.id`
3. CSS hides reply buttons on posts with class `non-owner-post`
4. MutationObserver ensures newly loaded posts are classified

### Top-Level Hiding (New)

1. JavaScript compares viewer ID with topic owner ID
2. Adds body class `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` if:
   - Viewer is anonymous, OR
   - Viewer ID ≠ Topic owner ID
3. CSS hides timeline and topic footer reply buttons when body class is present
4. Body class is removed when navigating away or conditions change

## Behavior Matrix

| Viewer | Post Author | Post-Level Button | Top-Level Buttons |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Owner | Owner | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |
| Owner | Non-owner | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |
| Non-owner | Owner | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| Non-owner | Non-owner | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden |
| Anonymous | Owner | ✅ Visible | ❌ Hidden |
| Anonymous | Non-owner | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden |

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Tests verify:
- ✅ Post classification (owner-post vs non-owner-post)
- ✅ Body class presence when viewer is not owner
- ✅ Body class absence in unconfigured categories
- ✅ Body class absence when setting is disabled
- ✅ Feature works in both filtered and regular views

Run tests in Discourse development environment:
```bash
# In Discourse root directory
bin/rake themes:qunit[log-view]
```

### Manual Testing

See [docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_TESTING_MANUAL.md](docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_TESTING_MANUAL.md) for comprehensive manual testing guide.

**Quick verification**:
1. Enable setting and configure category
2. As topic owner: All buttons visible
3. As non-owner: Top-level buttons hidden, post-level buttons hidden on non-owner posts
4. As anonymous: Same as non-owner

## Verification Checklist

- [x] JavaScript changes implemented
- [x] CSS rules added
- [x] Setting description updated
- [x] Tests updated
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] No syntax errors (diagnostics clean)
- [ ] Manual testing completed (requires Discourse instance)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to test environment**
   - Install updated theme component
   - Configure settings
   - Run manual tests

2. **Verify behavior**
   - Test as topic owner
   - Test as non-owner
   - Test as anonymous user
   - Test in configured and unconfigured categories

3. **Enable debug logging**
   - Monitor browser console
   - Verify body class toggling
   - Verify post classification
   - Check for errors

4. **Production deployment**
   - After successful testing
   - Monitor for issues
   - Collect user feedback

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found, rollback by:

1. **Disable the setting**:
   - Admin → Customize → Themes → Log View → Settings
   - Disable `hide_reply_buttons_for_non_owners`
   - This will restore all reply buttons

2. **Revert code changes** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

## Known Limitations

1. **Cannot prevent keyboard shortcuts**: Shift+R still works
2. **Cannot prevent API calls**: Technical users can still reply via API
3. **Not a security feature**: Use Discourse permissions for access control
4. **Does not check Allowed groups**: Independent of group access control

These are intentional limitations due to theme component sandboxing and the UI-only nature of the feature.

1. Check [docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_COMPLETE.md](docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_COMPLETE.md) troubleshooting section
2. Enable debug logging and check browser console
3. Review [docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_TESTING_MANUAL.md](docs/HIDE_REPLY_BUTTONS_TESTING_MANUAL.md) for debugging commands
