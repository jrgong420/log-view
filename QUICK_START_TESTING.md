# Quick Start Testing Guide - Embedded Reply Buttons

## üöÄ Quick Test (5 minutes)

This is a fast way to verify the embedded reply buttons feature is working.

### Prerequisites
- Discourse instance with log-view theme component installed
- A topic with replies from multiple users
- Browser with DevTools (F12)

### Step 1: Open Console
1. Press **F12** to open browser DevTools
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Clear the console (optional)

### Step 2: Navigate to Test Topic
1. Go to a topic in a configured category
2. Look for the console message:
   ```
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Initializer starting...
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Global click handler bound successfully
   ```
   ‚úÖ If you see this, the feature is loaded

### Step 3: Enter Filtered View
1. Click the "Show Owner Comments" toggle button
2. Wait for the page to reload with `?username_filters=...` in the URL
3. Look for console messages:
   ```
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Page change detected
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Owner comment mode: true
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Found X embedded post sections
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Button injected successfully
   ```
   ‚úÖ If you see this, buttons are being injected

### Step 4: Visual Check
1. Scroll through the topic
2. Look for embedded posts (replies from other users shown in gray boxes)
3. Each embedded post should have a small **"Reply"** button
   ‚úÖ If you see reply buttons, injection is working

### Step 5: Test Composer Opening
1. Click any **"Reply"** button on an embedded post
2. Look for console messages:
   ```
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Reply button clicked
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Opening composer with options
   [Embedded Reply Buttons] Composer opened successfully
   ```
3. The composer should open at the bottom of the page
4. Check the reply indicator shows the correct username
   ‚úÖ If composer opens with correct context, feature is working!

### Step 6: Test Filtered View Persistence
1. Type a test message in the composer
2. Click "Reply" to post
3. Verify you stay on the filtered view (URL still has `?username_filters=...`)
   ‚úÖ If you stay in filtered view, persistence is working!

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

If all steps above pass, the feature is working correctly!

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### No console messages
**Problem**: Feature not loading
**Fix**:

### No reply buttons visible
**Problem**: Buttons not injected
