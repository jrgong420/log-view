# Fix: Category Scoping for Reply Button Styling

## Problem

The "Hide reply buttons for non owners" feature was applying visual styling changes to reply buttons (`button.post-action-menu__reply` and `button.post-action-menu__show-replies`) in **ALL categories**, regardless of the "Owner comment categories" setting.

**Expected behavior**: Visual styling should only apply to topics in categories specified in the "Owner comment categories" setting.

## Root Cause

The visual styling rules in `common/common.scss` were defined globally (not scoped to any conditional class), so they affected all topics across all categories. While the hiding logic (via `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` body class) was correctly gated by category checks in the JavaScript, the styling was not.

## Solution

Added a new body class `owner-comments-enabled` that is set when:
1. The `hide_reply_buttons_for_non_owners` setting is enabled, AND
2. The current topic is in a category listed in `owner_comment_categories`

This class is **independent of viewer ownership** (unlike `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` which is owner-specific). It serves purely as a scoping mechanism for visual styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Changes (`javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/hide-reply-buttons.gjs`)

**Added:**
- New body class `owner-comments-enabled` is added after setting and category checks pass
- Class is removed in all early-exit guards (setting disabled, no topic, category not configured)
- Updated documentation comments to explain both body classes

**Key code locations:**
- Lines 20-26: Updated header documentation
- Lines 184, 195, 216: Remove `owner-comments-enabled` in guard clauses
- Lines 222-225: Add `owner-comments-enabled` after category check passes

### 2. SCSS Changes (`common/common.scss`)

**Scoped the following styling blocks under `body.owner-comments-enabled`:**
- Reply button icon color override (lines 74-78)
- Post action menu visual consistency rules (lines 92-191):
  - Desktop show-replies button styling
  - Mobile show-replies button styling  
  - Reply button primary action styling

**Result:** These styles now only apply when the body has the `owner-comments-enabled` class, which only happens in configured categories.

### 3. Test Changes (`test/acceptance/hide-reply-buttons-non-owners-test.js`)

**Added new test suite:** "Hide Reply Buttons - Category Scoping"

**Tests added:**
1. Verifies `owner-comments-enabled` class is present in configured category
2. Verifies `owner-comments-enabled` class is NOT present in non-configured category
3. Verifies posts are not classified in non-configured category

**Enhanced existing test:**
- Added assertion to verify `owner-comments-enabled` is not present when setting is disabled

## Body Classes Summary

After this fix, there are two distinct body classes:

### `owner-comments-enabled`
- **Purpose**: Scope visual styling to configured categories
- **Added when**: Setting enabled AND topic in configured category
- **Independent of**: Viewer identity (owner vs non-owner)
- **Used by**: SCSS to gate visual styling rules

### `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners`
- **Purpose**: Hide top-level reply buttons for non-owners
- **Added when**: Setting enabled AND topic in configured category AND viewer is NOT the topic owner
- **Dependent on**: Viewer identity
- **Used by**: SCSS to hide reply buttons via `display: none`

## Verification Checklist

### Automated Tests
- [x] No syntax errors in modified files
- [ ] Acceptance tests pass (requires Discourse dev environment)

### Manual QA (To be performed)
- [ ] **Configured category + owner viewer**: 
  - Body has `owner-comments-enabled` class
  - Body does NOT have `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` class
  - Reply buttons have custom styling (primary colors)
  - Reply buttons are visible
  
- [ ] **Configured category + non-owner viewer**:
  - Body has `owner-comments-enabled` class
  - Body has `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` class
  - Reply buttons have custom styling (primary colors)
  - Top-level reply buttons are hidden
  
- [ ] **Non-configured category + any viewer**:
  - Body does NOT have `owner-comments-enabled` class
  - Body does NOT have `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` class
  - Reply buttons have default Discourse styling
  - Reply buttons are visible (normal behavior)
  
- [ ] **Setting disabled + any category**:
  - Body does NOT have `owner-comments-enabled` class
  - Body does NOT have `hide-reply-buttons-non-owners` class
  - Reply buttons have default Discourse styling
  - Reply buttons are visible (normal behavior)

## Files Modified

1. `javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/hide-reply-buttons.gjs`
2. `common/common.scss`
3. `test/acceptance/hide-reply-buttons-non-owners-test.js`

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Hiding logic remains unchanged
- Only adds scoping to visual styling that was previously global
- No changes to settings or API

## Performance Impact

✅ **Negligible**
- Single body class addition/removal per page change
- No additional DOM queries or observers
- SCSS selector specificity increased by one level (minimal impact)
