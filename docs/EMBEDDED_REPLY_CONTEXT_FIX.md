# Embedded Reply Context Fix

## Problem Summary

When clicking reply buttons on embedded posts, the composer was opening but replying to the **wrong post**. Instead of replying to the parent post that the embedded post was responding to, it was replying to the embedded post itself or to the topic in general.

### Example Scenario

**Before the fix:**
1. Topic owner (Alice) makes post #1
2. User Bob makes post #82 replying to Alice's post #1
3. In filtered view, Bob's post #82 appears as an embedded post under Alice's post #1
4. When clicking "Reply" on Bob's embedded post #82, the composer opened replying to **the topic** (wrong!)

**After the fix:**
1. Topic owner (Alice) makes post #1
2. User Bob makes post #82 replying to Alice's post #1
3. In filtered view, Bob's post #82 appears as an embedded post under Alice's post #1
4. When clicking "Reply" on Bob's embedded post #82, the composer opens replying to **Alice's post #1** (correct!)

## Root Cause

The code was using the embedded post itself as the reply target, rather than finding the parent post that the embedded post was replying to.

### Previous Logic (Wrong)

```javascript
// Find the embedded post
let parentPost = topic.postStream?.posts?.find(
  (p) => p.post_number === Number(postNumber)
);

// Open composer replying to the embedded post
await composer.open({
  action: "reply",
  topic: topic,
  post: parentPost, // This is the embedded post, not its parent!
  // ...
});
```

### New Logic (Correct)

```javascript
// 1. Find the embedded post
let embeddedPost = topic.postStream?.posts?.find(
  (p) => p.post_number === Number(postNumber)
);

// 2. Get the parent post number from the embedded post
let parentPostNumber = embeddedPost.reply_to_post_number;

// 3. Find the parent post
let parentPost = topic.postStream?.posts?.find(
  (p) => p.post_number === Number(parentPostNumber)
);

// 4. Open composer replying to the parent post
await composer.open({
  action: "reply",
  topic: topic,
  post: parentPost, // This is the parent post that the embedded post was replying to
  // ...
});
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Renamed variable for clarity**: Changed `parentPost` to `embeddedPost` to make it clear we're first finding the embedded post
2. **Extract parent post number**: Use `embeddedPost.reply_to_post_number` to find which post the embedded post was replying to
3. **Find parent post**: Look up the parent post in the topic's post stream
4. **Fallback handling**: If parent post is not in stream, try fetching it or using `replyToPostNumber`
5. **Topic-level reply fallback**: If embedded post has no `reply_to_post_number`, reply to the topic

### Flow Diagram

```
User clicks Reply button on embedded post
    ↓
Extract post number/ID from DOM
    ↓
Find embedded post model (fetch if needed)
    ↓
Get embedded post's reply_to_post_number
    ↓
Find parent post model (fetch if needed)
    ↓
Open composer with parent post as reply target
```

### Fallback Strategy

The implementation includes multiple fallback strategies to handle edge cases:

#### 1. Embedded Post Not in Stream
If the embedded post is not loaded in `topic.postStream.posts`:
- Try fetching it from the server using `store.find("post", postId)`
- If fetch fails, give up (cannot determine parent)

#### 2. Parent Post Not in Stream
If the parent post is not loaded in `topic.postStream.posts`:
- Try fetching it using `store.query("post", { topic_id, post_ids })`
- If fetch fails, try opening composer with `replyToPostNumber` parameter
- If that fails, give up

#### 3. No Parent Post (Top-Level Post)
If the embedded post has no `reply_to_post_number`:
- Reply to the topic instead of a specific post
- This handles the edge case where an embedded post is a top-level post

## Code Location

**File**: `javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/embedded-reply-buttons.gjs`
**Lines**: 383-569 (reply context resolution logic)
**Function**: Global click handler for `.embedded-reply-button`

### Key Code Sections

1. **Embedded Post Resolution** (lines 383-430): Find the embedded post model
2. **Parent Post Number Extraction** (lines 432-449): Get `reply_to_post_number`
3. **Parent Post Resolution** (lines 451-521): Find the parent post model
4. **Composer Opening** (lines 523-569): Open composer with correct reply context

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup**: Create a topic with owner comment mode enabled
2. **Create posts**:
   - Owner (Alice) creates post #1
   - User (Bob) replies to post #1, creating post #82
3. **Enter filtered view**: Navigate to topic with `?username_filters=alice`
4. **Verify embedded post**: Bob's post #82 should appear as an embedded post under Alice's post #1
5. **Click Reply button**: Click the "Reply" button on Bob's embedded post
6. **Verify composer context**: 
   - Composer should open
   - Should show "Replying to @alice in post #1"
   - Should NOT show "Reply to topic" or "Replying to @bob"

### Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging. Check browser console for:

```
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Target embedded post model: <Post>
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Embedded post number: 82
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Embedded post reply_to_post_number: 1
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Parent post number (reply target): 1
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Parent post model: <Post>
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Using parent post as reply target: <Post>
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Opening composer with parent post: {...}
[Embedded Reply Buttons] Composer opened successfully
```

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Correct**: Composer shows "Replying to @alice in post #1"
❌ **Wrong**: Composer shows "Reply to topic" or "Replying to @bob in post #82"

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Embedded post not in stream**: Fetches from server
2. **Parent post not in stream**: Fetches from server or uses `replyToPostNumber`
3. **Top-level embedded post**: Replies to topic instead
4. **Fetch failures**: Graceful error handling with console logs
5. **Missing `reply_to_post_number`**: Falls back to topic-level reply

## Benefits

### 1. Correct Reply Context
- Users reply to the right post (the parent, not the embedded post)
- Maintains conversation threading
- Preserves reply relationships

### 2. Better User Experience
- Intuitive behavior: replying to an embedded post replies to its parent
- Matches user expectations
- Maintains conversation flow

### 3. Preserves Filtered View
- User stays in filtered view after replying
- No navigation away from current context
- Seamless workflow

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Visual indicator**: Show which post will be replied to before clicking
2. **Reply to embedded post option**: Add a separate button to reply to the embedded post itself
3. **Batch preloading**: Preload parent posts when embedded posts are shown
4. **Caching**: Cache parent post lookups to avoid repeated fetches
5. **Better error messages**: Show user-friendly error messages instead of console logs
