# Auto-Refresh Embedded Posts - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

Automatic refresh of embedded posts section after a user submits a reply via the embedded reply button.

## The Problem

When users clicked reply on an embedded post and submitted their reply:
- ✅ Post was created successfully
- ❌ New reply was NOT visible until manual "load more replies" click
- ❌ Required extra user interaction

## The Solution

Listen to Discourse's `composer:saved` event and automatically click the "load more replies" button to refresh the embedded posts section.

## How It Works

1. **Event Listener:** Listens to `appEvents.on("composer:saved")`
2. **Guard Checks:** Only triggers in owner comment mode for actual replies
3. **Find Parent:** Locates the parent post element using `reply_to_post_number`
4. **Click Button:** Programmatically clicks "load more replies" button
5. **Fallback:** Uses MutationObserver if button appears with delay
6. **Timeout:** 5-second timeout prevents infinite observation

## Code Changes

**File:** `javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/embedded-reply-buttons.gjs`

**Added:**
- `composerEventsBound` flag (line 7)
- Auto-refresh logic (lines 491-553)

**Total:** ~65 lines of new code

## Key Features

✅ **Immediate Feedback:** New reply appears without manual interaction  
✅ **Robust Timing:** Handles both immediate and delayed button appearance  
✅ **Context-Aware:** Only triggers in owner comment mode  
✅ **No Memory Leaks:** Proper observer cleanup with timeout  
✅ **SPA Compatible:** Uses Discourse event system and proper scheduling  

## Testing

### Quick Test
1. Navigate to topic in filtered view (owner comment mode)
2. Click reply button on an embedded post
3. Write and submit reply
4. **Expected:** Embedded posts section refreshes automatically
5. **Expected:** New reply appears immediately

### What to Check
- [ ] Reply appears without clicking "load more replies"
- [ ] Works with fast and slow network
- [ ] Doesn't trigger in normal (non-filtered) view
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Doesn't break existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `javascripts/discourse/api-initializers/embedded-reply-buttons.gjs` - Main implementation
2. `docs/AUTO_REFRESH_EMBEDDED_POSTS_INVESTIGATION.md` - Investigation notes
3. `docs/AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed documentation
4. `docs/AUTO_REFRESH_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **Test** in development environment
2. **Verify** all edge cases work correctly
3. **Monitor** for any issues or timing problems
4. **Consider** adding visual feedback (loading indicator, highlight new post)
5. **Merge** into main when ready

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. **Quick fix:** Comment out lines 491-553 in `embedded-reply-buttons.gjs`
2. **Full rollback:** Revert commit `03a4817`
3. **Debug:** Add console logging to identify timing issues

## Related Features

- **Embedded Reply Buttons:** Adds reply buttons to embedded posts
- **Owner Comment Mode:** Filters topics to show only owner's posts
- **MutationObserver Pattern:** Detects dynamically loaded content

## Technical Notes

- Uses Discourse's `app-events` service
- Leverages existing "load more replies" mechanism
- Two-tier approach: immediate click + MutationObserver fallback
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Compatible with Ember.js SPA architecture
